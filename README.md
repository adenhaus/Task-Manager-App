# Task Manager App

> This is the final Captsone Project of Level 1 in the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp.

#### Manifesto
Task-management software for a small business. The culmination of 1 month of learning to program in Python, including the following concepts: data types, variables, lists, control structures, iteration statements, error handling, I/O and functions.

#### Structure
The user is able to log in the the system and access a plethora of functionality. Pretty much everything is defined in a function and then called in a main loop after the user is logged in.
