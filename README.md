# Task Manager App

> Task management software built in Python.

#### Functionality
Task-management software for a small business. This application lets you add new users, including an admin with additional admin powers. Each user creates a password for the a secure log-in. Tasks can be created, with various specifications. Users can be assigned to various tasks and can mark them as complete. The admin can view detailed statistics about the state of the tasks such as how many have been completed, which users are assigned to each task and more. All of this information is written to .txt files.

#### Structure
The user is able to log in the the system and access a plethora of functionality. In typical Python fashion, most functionality is defined at the top of the task_manager.py file and then called in a main loop once the user is logged in.

#### Files
In this repo you will find the main task_manager.py file as well as the .txt files it reads and writes to.
